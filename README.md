# Project summary

## The Issue our Project Solves

KYC (Know Your Customer) verification is a necessary process in various industries such as banking, finance, and insurance. However, the traditional KYC process is time-consuming and requires customers to physically visit the respective offices, which can be inconvenient and expensive. Moreover, the manual KYC process can also lead to human errors, making it less reliable. This project aims to address these issues by developing an online KYC app that can extract useful information such as Aadhar card number, PAN number, name, date of birth, address, etc from the scanned copies of Aadhar card, PAN card, and GST document. 

## How Our Technology Solution Can Help

The solution leverages Azure services for efficient identity verification.

## Our Idea
The core idea of the project is to develop a cloud-based KYC solution using Microsoft Azure services to extract and validate information from scanned copies of Aadhar card, PAN card, and GST document. This project aims to simplify the traditional KYC process, which is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors, by providing businesses with a scalable, secure, and efficient way to verify the identity of their customers.

The cloud-based KYC solution will leverage the power of Azure services. The web application will be hosted on Azure App Service, which provides a fully-managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. The KYC verification process will begin when a customer uploads a scanned copy of their Aadhar card, PAN card, and GST document to the web application. Azure Form Recognizer will extract relevant information from these documents using machine learning models that can recognize text, tables, and other data. The solution will use GitHub to manage the codebase, enabling seamless collaboration and version control.

In conclusion, Azure KYC solution offers a comprehensive and efficient way for businesses to verify the identity of their customers while reducing the cost and time associated with traditional KYC methods. The solution leverages the latest advancements in Azure services to deliver a reliable, scalable, and secure KYC solution for businesses in variousÂ industries.
